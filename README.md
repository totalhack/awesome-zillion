A collection of awesome [Zillion](https://github.com/totalhack/zillion/) projects and resources.

Part of the goal of Zillion is to share common datasets for plug n' play use. If you have a dataset
you think would fit this approach please create a public project and share it here! What kind of projects
fit? Here are some examples of datasets everyone could be re-using:

* Geographical information, such as a dimension table of US Zip Codes
* A date dimension table that include attributes such as whether the date is a holiday
* Demographic data

## Frontends

* [Zillion Web](https://github.com/totalhack/zillion-web)

## Warehouses

* [Zillion Baseball Example](https://github.com/totalhack/zillion-baseball)
